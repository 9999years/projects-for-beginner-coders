# Projects for Beginner Coders

This is a list of projects that beginners might enjoy to make. See the
“rationale” section at the bottom for details. These projects should be “easy”
in the sense that they don’t contain that many parts that need to work together.

They are organized by “type” — not by what area of computing they touch upon
(filesystems, networking, graphics) — but by what type of person they might
appeal to.

## General tips

Python is a great language for beginners. If you want to make graphics,
[turtle] is a great library that comes with Python!

## Words and literature

* Check for palindromes

* Mad libs

* Generate sentences

## Visual art and pictures

* Make a spirograph

* Draw the Mandelbrot set

# Rationale

Many of the lists of projects for beginners out there are Bad. The projects
usually fall into one or both of two categories:

1. **Extremely uncompelling** — these projects are not *interesting*; they don’t
   solve a problem. I had the most fun as a kid when I was making things to “do
   something cool” for me, whether it was generating fake practice charts for
   band class, making a program to solve my math homework problems, or making
   programs to draw cool pictures on my TI-83.

   Examples: Generate a bunch of prime numbers, make an alarm clock, make a
   checkbook, implement Dijkstra’s algorithm.

2. **Extremely difficult** — I’ve seen lists of [“projects anyone can do”][karan]
   filled with projects that would stump me today.

   Examples: Make an FTP server, make a syntax highlighter, make a regex parser.
   Many of these are *also* very uncompelling for people who don’t already code!
