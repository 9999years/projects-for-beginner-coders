# About

This file stores “meta-information” about the project

# What kind of projects belong here?

Projects listed in this repository should:

* Fit in one file
* Require as little domain knowledge as possible
  * No protocol nonsense, no worrying about race conditions or efficiency, no
    parsers, etc.
* Be fun and interesting for someone who doesn’t care about computers —
  **computering should not be the end goal!**

# Rationale

Many of the lists of projects for beginners out there are Bad. The projects
usually fall into one or both of two categories:

1. **Extremely uncompelling** — these projects are not *interesting*; they don’t
   solve a problem. I had the most fun as a kid when I was making things to “do
   something cool” for me, whether it was generating fake practice charts for
   band class, making a program to solve my math homework problems, or making
   programs to draw cool pictures on my TI-83.

   Examples: Generate a bunch of prime numbers, make an alarm clock, make a
   checkbook, implement Dijkstra’s algorithm.

2. **Extremely difficult** — I’ve seen lists of [“projects anyone can do”][karan]
   filled with projects that would stump me today.

   Examples: Make an FTP server, make a syntax highlighter, make a regex parser.
   Many of these are *also* very uncompelling for people who don’t already code!

# To-Do

* Add a glossary and key words (like “string concatenation” or “permutation”) to
  ideas
